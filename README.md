<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![image](https://github.com/misoe92/AssetSnap-Godot/assets/38956582/a513a5e4-54de-40b1-afe4-57fcee358afe)

This toolkit was started as a way for me to give my nephew an easier entry in to game development, more specifically 3D game development. This toolkit essentially aims to statisfy all the level building needs that you might have. And if it does not yet do this, please post an issue and we will see on how we can fit your need into the calculation. It is a work in progress, so bugs still might occur. Therefore usage in professional environment should still be cautious. Will update this part of the text when the product is polished enough for a professional usage case. 

The plugin is quite extensive already, but below you can get a heads up about the overall functionality that it provides below. And then i can only recommend to download it and try it out. It is after all completely free - and i would love the feedback.

### Groups
![image](https://github.com/misoe92/AssetSnap-Godot/assets/38956582/0043dd77-443a-412e-9682-0b9caf5bfdfa)

Currently it allows for the creation of Groups, which are groups of 3D objects that have their positions defined in local space. Which allows for building a house as an example with modular blocks and then easily use it again, or duplicate an earlier house, change 1 block and use that. 

#### Persistency
Groups inner structure are persistent, meaning if you change an group 3D object origin, rotation or scale it will instantly be updated on all instances of that group. This does not count for things like default collisions and more that are set when you spawn your group.

#### 3D Preview
![image](https://github.com/misoe92/AssetSnap-Godot/assets/38956582/85489a08-130f-4676-bc1d-453dd533f6fa)

Preview your creation in a 3D Preview environment while you are building it. Allowing you to fly around your 3D object to ensure all the details are as they need to be.

### Libraries
![image](https://github.com/misoe92/AssetSnap-Godot/assets/38956582/8e00a72f-7ade-4c0e-96ab-0611cdcc4fc7)

Create libraries that houses a folder and all of it 3D models, allowing you to search, place, and perform various actions on the models when placing them in the 3D world.

#### Add and remove libraries
You can add and remove libraries easily from the main page of the tab "Assets"

#### Placement Modes
##### Simple placement mode
Use to place mesh instances, this is mainly for fewer spawns and where you need certain things to have a certain script and such.

##### Advanced placement mode
Use to place multi meshes, in configureable chunks. Which allows for a more optimized end result when you are spawning alot of objects.

#### Continuos placement
Fast placement of many objects with continous placement, which relieves you from the task of having to select the item again and again.
All you have to do is hold alt + shift.

#### Drag path placement
Drag a path and spawn a configureable amount using an offset to control the total spawn amount.

#### Plane Snapping
Snap to planes on the X,Y and Z Axis, the axis boundary can be configured to match the needs you have for the task.

#### Object Snapping
Snap to other placed 3D objects in the 3D world as long as they have been spawned with the same spawn layer as the object you are spawning.

#### Auto collisions
Easy auto collisions for your objects when you space them, or change them afterwards directly while the object is in focus.

#### Grab already placed objects
By holding shift + alt and clicking A you can grab up already placed objects in the world, making it an ease to pick them up and move them to their new place.

#### Inspector
Ability to keep an eye on the states, this is mainly usefull when things don't work.. So let's hope it does not need to be used.

### Modifiers
Ability to convert Mesh instances into Scatter or Array Modifiers.

#### Scatter Modifier
Scatter an configureable amount of entries of an object in an specified radius with various of tools and optimizations to go with the modifier.

#### Array Modifier
Spawn an configureable array of objects with various of tools and optimizations to go with the modifier.

### Built With

This plugin was build with Godot and for Godot.

Beside that Icons from <a href="https://heroicons.com">HeroIcons</a> have been used.
And 3D objects from libraries from [Here](https://fertile-soil-productions.itch.io/modular-village-pack) and [Here](https://fertile-soil-productions.itch.io/modular-terrain-pack) has been used while building it, and is the 3D objects seen in the preview images.

* For Windows
  ```sh
  https://godotengine.org/download/windows/
  ```
* For Linux
  ```sh
  https://godotengine.org/download/linux/
  ```
